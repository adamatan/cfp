## Presentation

### Title

Building a Serverless, production-ready webapp in 45 minutes

### Overview (1-2 paragraphs)

How do we build a cost-effective, production-ready, scalable web application with a beautiful UI, in 45 minutes? With Serverless tools.

Building a web application is a complex task: backend application servers, databases, network components, frontend framework, and more. These parts are often built by different stakeholders, and after the web application is shipped, the never-ending chore of technical maintenance, version upgrade, security patching and backup begins. An Open Serverless platforms mitigates most of these pains. In this demo session we will build a full web application using Corvid, the Wix Serverless coding platform built into its powerful UI Editor, and explain how Serverless design patterns improve development velocity and experience while delivering unbeatable business value.
