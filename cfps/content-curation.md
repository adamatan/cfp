# Title
Content curation for professional communities

# Abstract
The success of professional communities - in-office tech talks, meetup groups or conferences - is based on the quality of their content. With great content, communities thrive; with mediocre content, communities turn into a free-pizza hangouts. In this session, I will share my experience as a member of the leadership teams of various technological communities, and give practical tips for selecting good sessions and optimizing their quality. My session will be practical in nature and will feature my recipe for content curation and moderation.
