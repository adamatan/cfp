# Serverless Workshop
A practical workshop for building a Serverless app backed by Redis.

## Elevator Pitch (300 characters)
This workshop will guide the attendees through  building a live, fully-functional and deployed Serverless app backed by Redis. We sill start with "Hello, World" and add more and more functionality as time permits. With every new feature, we will discuss the right way to build it in order to minimize latency, cost and code complexity.
Attendees will gain practical Serverless skills, as well as good understanding of the basic design patterns and trade-offs involved in Serverless apps.

## Technical level
* This session is technical. Attendees should bring laptops with a working development environment.
* No prior Serverless knowledge assumed.

## Talk Format
Workshop (up to 50 attendees).

## Duration
45-120 minutes.

## Special requirements
* WiFi
* Workshop setting: Desks with AC power for laptops
* Projector and desk for the instructor

## Outline
* Basic Serverless concepts: Functions, design patterns, best practices (5-10 minutes)
* Installations and registrations: We'll email the attendees to do these in advance to save time, but we double check anyhow
  * Redis labs account (or any other hosted account)
  * FaaS account near the Redis account (for latency and cost reasons)
  * git, Node / Python
* Running a "hello, world" function
* Connecting the "Hello, world" to Redis
* Building a graph DB on Redis
