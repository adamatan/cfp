# Title
Thinks Functions

# Elevator Pitch (300 characters)
What would apps look like if we never had to think about servers, performance or even cost? This session demonstrates how an Uber-like ridesharing application can be built entirely from functions -  starting with a architectural overview and progressing to actual JS code.

# Description
This session demonstrates how a real-time app can be built solely out of functions while remaining responsive and cost-effective. We present a architecture overview of the app, and walk through the process of splitting it into granular services.

Then, code! We write an entire service - the ridesharing service, for hailing a car in real time - in functions, and describe how we can express concurrent invocations of such functions - ranging from simple parallel execution, to applying numerical and logical operators on cloud functions.

To conclude, we will analyze cost and performance considerations and the limitations of current platforms.

Is it practical?
Yes. Most features are applicable using third-party libraries.

Is it technical?
Yes. We discuss performance and cost, but most of the session is code.

Outline:
* Architecture
* Advantages of functions
* Code
* Cost & Performance

# Benefits to the Ecosystem
This session features design patterns and source code of an entire app based on functions. The ecosystem will be presented with new development techniques, semantics and best practices for function-based software, helping define FaaS craftsmanship.

# List any technical requirements that you have for your presentation over and above the standard projector, screen and wireless internet
Two mic sets. I will give this session with another speaker, Avner Braverman (https://www.linkedin.com/in/avnerbraverman/)

# Speaker 2 | Biography

Avner has been working with distributed operating systems since his school days. He co-founded XIV, a distributed storage company, Parallel Machines, a high-performance analytics company, and recently Binaris, a high-performance serverless company. Avner’s “full stack” ranges from silicon architecture, through kernel design and up to JavaScript applications.
